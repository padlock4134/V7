          <p>
            Every Saturday morning, Grandpa Fred would gather all the grandkids for a big pancake breakfast. The kitchen was always alive with laughter, the smell of fresh pancakes, and the feeling that everyone belonged.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those mornings weren‚Äôt just about food‚Äîthey were about mentorship, family, and the simple joy of sharing a meal together. Porkchop is our way of honoring Grandpa Fred, letting everyone experience a piece of his kitchen, no matter where they are.

            <li className="mt-2"><strong>Do I have to be a chef?</strong><br />
              Porkchop is for everyone, from beginners to pros. Grandpa Fred believed good food is for all, and our platform guides you every step of the way.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-2"><strong>Is this expensive?</strong><br />
